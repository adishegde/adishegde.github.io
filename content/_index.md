I’m a PhD student in the [ARC](https://arc.isi.jhu.edu/) group at Johns Hopkins University where I’m advised by [Abhishek Jain](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~abhishek/) and [Matthew Green](https://isi.jhu.edu/~mgreen/). My research interests are in cryptography and more broadly, in theoretical computer science.

From June to July 2024, I visited [Geoffroy Couteau](https://geoffroycouteau.github.io/).
In 2021, I completed an Integrated Masters (B.Tech + M.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering at IIIT Bangalore, where I was advised by [Ashish Choudhury](https://sites.google.com/view/ashish-choudhury).
During Spring 2021, I worked with members of the CrIS Lab under the supervision of [Arpita Patra](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arpita/).
